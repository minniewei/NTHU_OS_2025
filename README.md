# 2025 NTHU OS
This assignment modifies xv6 to further optimize its performance.
Below are the changes made to xv6 in each branch:
* [os25-mp1](../../tree/os25-mp1): System calls
* [os25-mp2](../../tree/os25-mp2): Process scheduling
* [os25-mp3](../../tree/os25-mp3): Memory management
* [os25-mp4](../../tree/os25-mp4): Disk scheduling

Each branch is independent and demonstrates optimizations for a specific aspect of the xv6 operating system.
